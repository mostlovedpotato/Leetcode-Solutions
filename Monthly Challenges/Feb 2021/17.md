# Container with most water 

[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

**Above is the problem statement.**

**In this problem we will try two pointers one starting from left and one from the right and we go on calculating and keeping track of the max_area we need to calculate.**

### CPP Solution

```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n=height.size()-1;
        int max_area=0;
        int i=0,j=n,area=0;
        while(i<=j){
            //area at any point
            area=min(height[i],height[j])*(j-i);
            //max area
            max_area=max(max_area,area);
            
            if(height[i]<height[j]){
                i++;
            }else{
                j--;
            }
        }
        return max_area;
    }
};
```
