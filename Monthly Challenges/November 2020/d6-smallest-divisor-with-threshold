Problem is here on leetcode::


https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-smallest-divisor-given-a-threshold/


Quite interesting solution is by bit resembling to the binary search algo... for the given problem 


class Solution {
   public:
   bool ok(int x, vector <int> &nums, int th){
      int sum = 0;
      for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
         sum += ceil((double)nums[i]/(double)x);      // this function we use to check for each element if the sum is less than threshold 
      }
      return sum<=th;
   }
   int smallestDivisor(vector<int>& nums, int th) {
      int low = 1;
      int high = 1e7;
      while(low < high){                                                   
         int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
         if(ok(mid, nums, th)){                            // if Sum < threhold this happens that we know element lie in the first half
            high = mid;
         }else low = mid + 1;
      }
      return high;
   }
};
