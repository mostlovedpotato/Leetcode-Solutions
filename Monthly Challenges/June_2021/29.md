## Leetcode Solution to problem of the day.

### We just want to remove duplicates and check again if there are duplicates after removing first duplicates

**We just use one string and keep on pushing all the characters and compare it to the last character if both**
**are same that means we will pop the last character and push the next character if not same with last character in ans string**


```
class Solution {
public:
  string removeDuplicates(string s){
    string ans="";
    for(auto &ch:s)
    {
      if(!ans.empty() && ans.back()==ch){
        ans.pop_back();
      }else{
        ans.push_back(ch);
      }
    }
    return ans;
  }
};


```
